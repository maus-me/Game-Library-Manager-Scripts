Torrent handling module for Game Library Manager Scripts.

This module provides functionality for:
- Connecting to qBittorrent via its API
- Monitoring torrents in a specified category
- Processing completed torrents by moving them to the game library
- Renaming game folders based on GOG metadata
- Deleting torrents from qBittorrent after processing

The module uses a configuration file to determine paths, connection details,
and other settings.
